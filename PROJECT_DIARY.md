# dex Labs Email System - Project Diary

## Project Overview
**Purpose**: Institutional email system for dex Labs using React Email and Resend API
**Repository**: https://github.com/gustavo-beltrami/dex-labs-email
**Status**: Active Development

---

## Session 1 - Initial Setup & Acquisition Announcement Email
**Date**: October 16, 2025

### Project Objectives
- Create professional email templates for dex Labs institutional communications
- First use case: Announce company acquisition to customers
- Establish reusable infrastructure for future email campaigns

### Technical Stack Decisions
- **Email Framework**: React Email (component-based email templates)
- **Email Service Provider**: Resend API
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Asset Hosting**: GitHub public repository (for reliable CDN-like access to email assets)

### Brand Identity & Design Standards
Established the following brand guidelines for all email templates:

- **Primary Brand Color**: `#4338ca` (indigo blue)
- **Typography**: Inter font family
- **Background**: White (`#ffffff`)
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Logo: Hosted on GitHub
  - Hero banners: 12px border-radius for modern, friendly appearance
  - Clean, minimal design aesthetic

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Project Setup
- Initialized React Email project with TypeScript support
- Configured Resend API integration
- Created `.env` file structure for API key management
- Added `.env.example` for team documentation

**Package Dependencies**:
```json
{
  "@react-email/components": "^0.0.30",
  "react-email": "^3.0.3",
  "resend": "^4.0.1"
}
```

#### 2. Asset Hosting Strategy
**Decision**: Use GitHub public repository for hosting email assets instead of traditional CDN

**Rationale**:
- Email clients require publicly accessible URLs for images
- GitHub provides reliable, fast access to repository files
- Eliminates need for separate CDN setup
- Version control for assets alongside code

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/gustavo-beltrami/dex-labs-email

**Assets Created**:
- Logo image (dex Labs branding)
- Hero banner with rounded corners (12px border-radius)

**Documentation**: Created `ASSET_HOSTING.md` explaining the GitHub hosting approach

#### 3. Acquisition Announcement Email Template

**Template Name**: `dex-acquisition-announcement.tsx`
**Location**: `/Users/G.Beltrami/Documents/Projects/9.react-email/emails/dex-acquisition-announcement.tsx`

**Content Structure**:
1. **Header Section**:
   - dex Labs logo
   - Centered, professional appearance

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Large hero banner image with rounded corners
   - Visual impact for important announcement

3. **Title**:
   - "Important Update About dex"
   - Sets appropriate tone for acquisition news

4. **Content Sections**:
   - **What This Means**: Explains acquisition without naming acquiring company (per business requirement)
   - **Timeline for Transition**: Details two-phase support plan
   - **Next Steps**: Clear call-to-action for users
   - **Thank You**: Gracious closing acknowledging customer loyalty

**Support Timeline Implemented**:
- **Phase 1**: 30 days of full platform support (all features functional)
- **Phase 2**: Platform remains accessible but no new features until February 1, 2026
- **Final Date**: February 1, 2026 - platform shutdown

**Design Details**:
- Responsive layout using React Email components
- Clean section spacing with HR dividers
- Professional color scheme matching brand identity
- Mobile-friendly structure

#### 4. Email Sending Infrastructure

**Script**: `/Users/G.Beltrami/Documents/Projects/9.react-email/src/send-acquisition-email.ts`

**Functionality**:
- Renders React Email template to HTML
- Sends via Resend API
- Configurable recipient, subject, from address
- Error handling and success confirmation

**Test Results**: Successfully sent test emails confirming:
- Template renders correctly in email clients
- Images load properly from GitHub hosting
- Layout is responsive and professional
- All content sections display as intended

### Key Design Decisions & Protocols

#### Why GitHub for Asset Hosting?
Traditional approach would use a CDN, but GitHub offers:
- Zero additional infrastructure
- Built-in version control
- Free, reliable hosting
- Fast global access
- Simple team workflow

#### Why Not Name the Acquiring Company?
Business decision to keep announcement focused on dex Labs and customer impact rather than new ownership details. This allows the message to center on user experience and transition timeline.

#### Email Template Structure Pattern
Established reusable pattern for future emails:
1. Logo header
2. Hero image (optional, for important announcements)
3. Clear title
4. Content sections with descriptive headings
5. Call-to-action
6. Gracious closing

This structure can be adapted for:
- Feature announcements
- Service updates
- Onboarding sequences
- Transactional emails

### Design Iterations & Refinements

Throughout the session, several design improvements were made based on feedback:

1. **Hero Section Evolution**:
   - Initial version: Simple logo header
   - Final version: Full hero banner with "Announcement" tagline and large heading
   - Rationale: Creates immediate visual impact for important company announcement

2. **Content Refinement**:
   - Removed specific platform recommendations (Fivetran, Airbyte)
   - Focus shifted to upcoming migration documentation
   - Why: Allows company to provide tailored recommendations later based on each customer's needs

3. **Profile Signature Component**:
   - Added founder photo (48px circular avatar)
   - Professional signature layout with name and title
   - Why: Personal touch from leadership for sensitive announcement

4. **Support Timeline Clarity**:
   - Highlighted support phases in visual callout box
   - Clear dates and expectations
   - 30 days full support → platform-only until Feb 1, 2026
